# Audio-Denoising-using-python-and-GNU-Radio-Companion
Audio denoising is a common problem faced in various applications, such as speech recognition, audio recording, and telecommunications. This project focuses on implementing a denoising technique using Python and GNU Radio Companion, an open-source software development toolkit for building software-defined radios.

Noise Removal Algorithms: Implement various state-of-the-art denoising algorithms, including spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, and adaptive filtering. These algorithms are designed to efficiently reduce different types of noise, such as background noise, white noise, and impulsive noise.

Integration with GNU Radio Companion: Explore the integration of Python scripts with GNU Radio Companion to create a user-friendly graphical interface for audio denoising. This allows users to interact with the denoising algorithms visually and intuitively, making the process accessible to both experts and beginners.

Real-time and Offline Denoising: Provide support for both real-time denoising, where the audio signal is processed as it is being recorded, and offline denoising, where pre-recorded audio files can be processed. This flexibility ensures compatibility with various scenarios, such as live audio streams or post-processing of recorded audio.

Visualization and Evaluation: Develop visualization tools to analyze the effectiveness of the denoising algorithms. Generate visual representations, such as spectrograms and waveforms, to compare the original and denoised audio signals. Additionally, include evaluation metrics to quantify the denoising performance, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mean squared error (MSE).

Documentation and Usage Examples: Provide detailed documentation, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and examples. Help users understand the project's capabilities and guide them through the process of integrating the denoising algorithms into their own applications.
